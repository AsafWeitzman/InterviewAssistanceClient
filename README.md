## Tech

The project was built using a range of modern web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as several popular libraries and frameworks. The frontend of the application was built using React.js, which provides a robust set of tools for building user interfaces. Additionally, the application uses the Framer Motion library for smooth animations, Material UI for styling and components, and the Victory Chart library for data visualization. To manage state and pass data between components, the project uses React Context API. For routing, the project uses React Router. These technologies work together to deliver a responsive and efficient user experience, while also providing a solid foundation for future development.
